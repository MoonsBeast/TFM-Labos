# Test Interactive Features

This page contains test elements to verify that our interactive features are working correctly.

## Test Code Block

Here's a test code block with copy functionality:

```bash
docker-compose up -d
nmap -sn 192.168.1.0/24
arp -a
```

## Test Tooltips

This paragraph contains several technical terms that should show tooltips: **ARP**, **DNS**, **MITM**, **spoofing**, **ettercap**, and **tcpdump**.

```
